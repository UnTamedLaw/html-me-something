<h3> Bangkok </h3>

<p>
My first stop in Thailand was the Bangkok, the capital of Thailand. There were many historic temples scattered around Bangkok.
My goal was to visit as many as I could in two days. I managed to hit about six different temples!

<p>A little less than 45 minutes on bus from Bangkok was the Ampawa Floating Market. Here vendors lined up along the river selling all kinds
of trinkets. I had dinner on a floating boat anchored to the side of the river!

<p>
I flew to the rural city of Chiang Mai, a two hour flight north of Bangkok. It was here I rode on the longest zipline in Thailand! At the
Flight of the Gibbon!

<h3>Phuket</h3>

<p>
After Chaing Mai, I flew to Phuket, one of the most popular tourist locations in Thailand. Here I went on many different tours of the surrounding
islands. One of my most memorable moments was diving into the water from the second deck of the boat I was on.

<h3>Krabi</h3>
<img class="double_border" src="images/Thai2.jpg" alt="Cave Climbing">
<p>
A few hours bus ride away from Phuket was the less well known Krabi. I took a miniboat to another island next to Krabi and entered a pitch dark cave
filled with bats, birds, and other creatures. Using only the light from my phone, I climbed to the top of the cave and saw another boat approaching the island.
